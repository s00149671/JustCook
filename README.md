JustCook Is a 3rd year group project 
Made using Java in Android Studio

API : Yummly
Database/Authentication : FireBase

The Idea behind the project is a reverse cook book so instead of you going out buying ingrediance for your recipe.
Instead you input the ingrediance you have and it outputs recipes tailored just for you
